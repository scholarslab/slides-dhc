    <h1>Suzhou Urban Cultural Landscapes Guide</h1>
    <p>Associate Professor Urban and Environmental Planning Jessica Sewell's Suzhou Urban Cultural Landscapes Guide explores the spaces and buildings of Suzhou, China, in their cultural and historical context. It connects everyday and ordinary spaces and buildings with themes that cut across multiple areas of the city, such as tourism and heritage, the informal economy, the sidewalk and alley as extensions of domestic space, spaces of production and selling, and public recreation. The study of urban cultural landscapes focuses on urban places as elements of culture that can be read to understand more about the people who created and live in them. The guide explores spaces that range from traditional vernacular urban spaces to spaces in rapidly expanding new towns to better understand the complexity of Suzhou and the ways that people live within it. It marries typologies, sites, history, and themes in order to open up our understanding of the urban cultural landscapes of one particular Chinese city and by extension, Chinese urban cultural landscapes more broadly.</p>
