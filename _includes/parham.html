    <h1>Layered Memories</h1>
    <p>Sociology Associate Professor Angel Parham's <a href="https://layeredmemories.iath.virginia.edu/"><em>Layered Memories</em></a> project excavates everyday histories by using what she calls <em>lieux de souvenir</em> analysis <em>lieux de souvenir</em> are places whose histories have been forgotten, submerged, or only very partially remembered. The focus is on three sites in New Orleans and their physical and social transformation over three centuries: the Hermann-Grima historic house; the site of a French Quarter hotel that used to be a slave market, and the New Orleans African American Museum located in the historic Black neighborhood Tremé. </p>
    <p>The project responds in part to protests over monuments, statues, and other historic sites that calls for an honest reckoning. Our ability to move forward as a national community in the U.S. requires that we find ways to make excellent and nuanced historical research intelligible and accessible to public audiences. Professor Parham's approach provides in-depth historical work on key sites that serve as entrées to conversations concerning larger social and political dynamics within a given neighborhood, city or region.</p>
