    <h1>Virtual Garden Dining in Pompeii
    </h1>
    <p>  Janet Dunkelbarger's project explores the physical, visual, and phenomenological aspects of dining outdoors in the gardens of Pompeii in the 1st century AD. Using virtual reality to rebuild several of Pompeiiâ€™s Garden Dining Spaces, the 3D reconstructions will create an integrated and immersive experience in which to explore the spaces and better understand their use and significance to the people of the ancient city.
