    <h1>Digital Sepoltuario</h1>
    <p>Independent art historian <a href="https://sepoltuario.iath.virginia.edu/"><em>Digital Sepoltuario: Memorial Culture in Renaissance Florence</em></a> offers students, scholars, and the public an online resource for the study of commemorative culture in Florence from the thirteenth through the eighteenth centuries. Based on the city-wide <em>sepoltuario</em> (tombs registers) compiled by the antiquarian Stefano Rosselli in the mid-seventeenth century, this site includes an illustrated catalogue of the city’s memorials that recreates the commemorative landscape of the pre-modern city. Florence’s extensive memorial culture was developed and propagated through thousands of decorated tombs personalized with inscriptions and coats of arms. These sepulchers were intended both to encourage prayers for the dead to ease their passage through Purgatory and to preserve and promote the family name for eternity. Groups who could sponsor altars and chapels ensured that masses and offices would further remediate their sin and aid their souls in their pursuit of heaven. Furnishings like holy water stoups, doorways, and altarpieces not only provided the clergy and faithful with what they needed for worship but also could be emblazoned with coats of arms and inscriptions as signs of their donors’ piety and reminders to pray for their souls.</p>
