    <h1>Virginia Emigrants to Liberia</h1>
    <p>A collaboration with independent scholars Jane Ailes and Deborah Lee, <a href="https://virginians-to-liberia.iath.virginia.edu/"><em>Virginia Emigrants to Liberia</em></a> is building a comprehensive dataset of 3,650 Virginia emigrants to Liberia based on documents, ship records, and letters associated with the American Colonization Society's sponsorship of African Americans voluntarily emigrating to the new colony of Liberia. </p>
    <p>The complex responses of Black and white Virginians to African colonization, slavery, freedom, and citizenship on both sides of the Atlantic are revealed in this collection of documents and data. They contribute greatly to otherwise scarce data on 19th century Black Virginians, including surnames, family and community relationships, occupations, former enslavers, literacy, and religion. As a public collaboration, this website is anticipated to reach scholars who can add more information about the individuals and families featured and will enlarge our understanding of the national political and social forces at work in antebellum America.</p>
