    <h1>Graduate Fellowships</h1>
    <p>The Scholars' Lab supports the work of emerging scholars and digital humanities practitionersâ€“particularly UVa graduate students. In addition to our general consultations (grad students are invited to write us for an appointment any time!), we offer three graduate fellowship programs that provide students with the time, space, and mentorship necessary to discover, explore, and build.</p>
